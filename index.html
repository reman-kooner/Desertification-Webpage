        <h2><span class="fact-head">Extent of Drying Lands</span></h2>
        <p>According to <a class="fact-link"
                href="https://time.com/7201214/three-quarters-of-the-earth-has-gotten-permanently-drier/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                target="_blank">Time</a>, a United Nations report warns that climate change caused by humans has brought
            permanent global dryness, where 77.6% of the land on our planet has experienced long-term aridity between
            1990 and 2020. Throughout this period, drylands expanded by 4.3 million square kilometers‚Äîan area larger
            than India‚Äîleading to economic loss, forced displacement, escalating wildfires, and degradation of the
            environment. Unlike reversible temporary droughts, this alteration is permanent, and this causes urgent
            questions about the future of food security and human displacement.</p>

        <p>Desertification, according to the <a class="fact-link"
                href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/646171/EPRS_BRI(2020)646171_EN.pdf"
                target="_blank">European Parliament</a>, endangers over 1 billion people in 100 countries by reducing
            the ability of land to support food production and biological diversity. Desertification is both
            human-induced and climate-related and can be reversed through proper monitoring and sustainable management.
            There is no coordinated effort by the EU to combat desertification despite nearly half of its member
            countries having regions that are affected. Agriculture has a dual function, both degrading the land and
            providing remedies in the form of sustainable farming techniques.</p>

        <h2><span class="fact-head">Human Displacement</span></h2>
        <p>Desertification, as defined by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), is one of the
            biggest current environmental challenges due to unsustainable agriculture, deforestation, and global
            warming. Dryland degradation endangers biodiversity, food security, and socio-economic stability, and puts
            50 million at risk of displacement in the next ten years. The UNCCD, established in 1994, provides
            international coordination for action to restore land productivity and mitigate the effects of drought,
            helping 70 countries affected by drought to develop action plans to combat desertification. Learn more <a

        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>higher threats of malnutrition from reduced food and water supplies</li>
            <li>more water- and food-borne diseases that result from poor hygiene and a lack of clean water</li>
            <li>respiratory diseases caused by atmospheric dust from wind erosion and other air pollutants</li>

        <h2><span class="fact-head">Global Initiatives</span></h2>
        <p>A $500 million Climate Investment Funds program will combat land degradation in Ethiopia with $37 million in
            CIF funding and the remaining funds provided by co-investors like the World Bank. The program will restore
            320,000 hectares of coffee forest, farmland, and rangeland and create a forest registry. It aims to enhance
            food security, empower small farmers, and integrate climate resilience into national policy.</p>

                href="https://www.sustainableagriculture.eco/post/a-path-to-preventing-desertification-and-restoring-our-land"
                target="_blank">Regenerative agriculture</a> offers a solution through soil reversal from degradation,
            encouraging biodiversity, and maximizing water use. Methods like cover cropping, rotational grazing, and
            decreased tillage avoid erosion, improve soil resilience, and store carbon, reversing climate change while
            ensuring food production. The investment in regenerative methods can restore degraded lands and prevent
            desertification, making the world's future more sustainable.</p>
